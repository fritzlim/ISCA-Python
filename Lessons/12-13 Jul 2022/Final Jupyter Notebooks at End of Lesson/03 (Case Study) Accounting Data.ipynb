Let's take a look at some real world applications of our newfound skills. Imagine the case of an accountant who needs to grab a bunch of data and then pull out the required information to answer a question. The steps they might normally take could be:\n","* export the data from the accounting platform(s)\n","* clean and format it in Excel, using multiple worksheets for different tables\n","* create pivot tables, vlookups, manual manipulations and formulas to get the data to answer the questions\n","\n","If you have a one-time task, this might be the best method! It might be quicker and easier just to use Excel. However, if you have a 1 hour task that repeats monthly, or weekly, it might save time in the long run to spend 6 hours writing some Python code to automate the task and save time in the long run. To that end, we're going to practice our dataframe abilities!\n","\n","The Excel sheets we import are based on actual reports from DEAR Inventory, an online inventory management system that we use for our online technology education store [gethacking.com](https://gethacking.com).
